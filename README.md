Email Configuration: Ensure your server is configured to send emails. If youâ€™re using a local development environment, you might need to set up a mail server or use a service like SendGrid or SMTP.
Security: For production, consider using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and validate/sanitize user inputs.
Email Headers: Customize the `From` header with a valid sender email address to avoid issues with spam filters.
